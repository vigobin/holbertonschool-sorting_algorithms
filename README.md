# Project 0x1A. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

## Description
This project involves learning about the following concepts:
 * At least four different sorting algorithms.
 * What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm.
 * How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input.
 * What is a stable sorting algorithm.

## Compilation
* Files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.

## Header File
* `sort.h` will include all the prototypes of the functions.
